# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing Memory Bank documentation for the coffee shop website project
- Documenting existing codebase and architecture
- Establishing patterns for future development and maintenance

## Recent Changes
- None (initial project state)
- Website appears to be in a completed state with all core sections implemented

## Next Steps
- Review code quality and identify potential improvements
- Consider adding interactive features (contact form, menu filtering)
- Optimize images and performance
- Add analytics tracking
- Implement SEO best practices

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Static Site Architecture**: Chosen for simplicity and low maintenance, suitable for a small business website
- **Inline CSS/JS**: Used for single-page design, consider external files for better organization if project grows
- **Russian Language**: Primary audience is Russian-speaking, maintain consistency
- **Mobile-First Design**: Critical for coffee shop customers who may browse on mobile devices

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **CSS Variables**: Extensive use of CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 992px, 768px, 576px for progressive enhancement
- **Component Structure**: Semantic HTML with class-based styling
- **Image Optimization**: Mix of local and external images (Unsplash), consider WebP format
- **Accessibility**: Basic implementation with semantic markup and keyboard navigation

## Project Insights
- **Strengths**: Clean, modern design that effectively communicates the coffee shop's warm, inviting brand
- **Technical Debt**: Inline styles and scripts may become unwieldy if adding more pages
- **Scalability**: Current structure supports easy addition of new menu items or sections
- **Performance**: External font and image dependencies could impact loading times
- **Maintenance**: Regular content updates needed for menu prices and seasonal offerings

## Current State Assessment
- **Functionality**: All core features working (navigation, responsive design, smooth scrolling)
- **Content**: Complete business information, menu, and contact details
- **Design**: Professional appearance matching coffee shop branding
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured HTML, organized CSS, functional JavaScript
